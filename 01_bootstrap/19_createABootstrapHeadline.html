<!--
    now let's build something from scratch to practice our html, css and bootstrap skills.
    we'll build a jQuery background, which we'll soon put to use in our jQuery challenge
    to start with, create an h3 element, with the text "jQuery Playground"
    colour your h3 element with thw "text-primary" Bootstrap class, and center it with the "text-center" Bootstrap class
-->
<h3 class="text-primary text-center">jQuery Playground</h3>
