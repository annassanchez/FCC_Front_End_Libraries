//jsx is a syntax that gets compiled into valid js
//sometimes, for readability, you might need to add comments to your code
//like most programming languages, jsx has its own way to do this
//to put comments inside jsx, you use the syntax "{/* */}" to wrap around the comment text
//
//the code editor has a jsx element similar to what you created in the last challenge
//add a comment somewhere within the provided "div" element, without modifying the existing "h1" or "p" elements
const JSX = (
    <div>
      <h1>This is a block of JSX</h1>
      <p>Here's a subtitle</p>
      {/*hello*/}
    </div>
  );
