<!--
    one feature that's different than css is it uses variables
    they are declared and set to store data, similar to js
    in js, variables are defined by using the let and const keywords
    in sass, variables with a "$" followed by the variable name
    here are a couple of examples:
    "$main-fonts: Arial, sans-serif;"
    "$headings-color: green;"
    and to use the variables:
    "
    h1 {
        font-family: $main-fonts;
        color: $heading-color;
    } 
    "
    one example where variables are useful is when a number of elements need to be the same colour
    if that colour has changed, the only place to edit the code is the variable value
-->
<!--
    create a vaiable "$text-color" and set it to "red"
    then change the value of the "color" property for the ".blog-post" and "h2" to the "$text-color" variable
-->
<style type='text/scss'>
    $text-color: red;
    .header{
      text-align: center;
    }
    .blog-post, h2 {
      color: $text-color;
    }
</style>
  
  <h1 class="header">Learn Sass</h1>
  <div class="blog-post">
    <h2>Some random title</h2>
    <p>This is a paragraph with some random text in it</p>
  </div>
  <div class="blog-post">
    <h2>Header #2</h2>
    <p>Here is some more random text.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="blog-post">
    <h2>Here is another header</h2>
    <p>Even more random text within a paragraph</p>
  </div>
