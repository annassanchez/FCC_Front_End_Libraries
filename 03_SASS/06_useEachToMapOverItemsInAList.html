    the last challenged showed how the "@for" directive uses a starting and ending value to loop a certain number of times
    sass also offers the "@each" directive which loops over eahc item in a list or map
    on each iteration, the variable gets assigned to the current value from the list or map
    "
    @each $color in blue, red, green {
        .#{$color}-text {color: $color;}
    }
    "
    a map has slightly different syntax
    here's an example:
    "
    $colors: (color1: blue, color2: red, color3: green);

    @each $key, $color in $color {
        .#{$color}-text {color: $color;}
    }
    "
    note that the "$key" variable is needed to reference the keys in the map
    otherwise, the compiled css would have "color1", "color2"...
    not of the above code examples are converted into the followitn css:
    "
    .blue-text {
        color: blue;
    }

    .red-text {
        color:red;
    }

    .green-text {
        color: green;
    }
    "

<!--
    write an "@each" directive that goes throgh a list: "blue, red, black" and assigns each variable to a ".color-bg" class, where the "color" part changes for each item
    each class should set the "background-color" the respective color
-->
<style type='text/scss'>
    $colors: (color1: blue, color2: black, color3: red);
  
    @each $key, $color in $colors {
      .#{$color}-bg {background-color: $color;}
    }
  
    div {
      height: 200px;
      width: 200px;
    }
  </style>
  
  <div class="blue-bg"></div>
  <div class="black-bg"></div>
  <div class="red-bg"></div>
