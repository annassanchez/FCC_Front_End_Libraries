<!--
    in sass, a mixin is a group of css declarations that can be reused throughout the style sheet
    newer css take time before they are fully adopted and ready to use in all browsers
    as features are added to browsers, css rules using them may need vendor prefixes
    consider "box-shadow":
    "
    div {
        -webkit-box-shadow: 0px 0px 4px #fff;
        -moz-box-shadow: 0px 0px 4px #fff;
        -ms-box-shadow: 0px 0px 4px #fff;
        box-shadow: 0px 0px 4px #fff;
    }
    "
    it's a lot of typing to re-write this rule for all elements that have a "box-shadow", or to change each value to test different effects
    mixins are like functions for css
    here is how to wirte one:
    "
    @mixin box-shadow($x, $y, $blur, $c){
        -webkit-box-shadow: $x $y $blur $c;
        -moz-box-shaddow: $x $y $blur $c;
        -ms-box-shadow: $x $y $blur $c;
        box-shadow: $x $y $blur $c;
    }
    "
    the definition starts with "@mixin" followed by a custom name
    the parameters ("$x", "$y", "$blur", and "$c" in the example) are optional
    now any time a "box-shadow" rule is needed, only a single line calling the mixin is called with the "@include" directive:
    "
    div {
        @include box-shadow(0px, 0px, 4px, #fff);	
    }
    "
-->
<!--
    write a mixin for "border-radius" and give it a "$radius" parameter
    it shuld use all the vendor prefixes from the example
    then use the "border-radius" mixin to give the "#awesome" element a border radius of "15px"
-->
<style type='text/scss'>
    @mixin border-radius($radius){
      -webkit-border-radius: $radius;
      -moz-border-radius: $radius;
      -ms-border-radius: $radius;
      border-radius: $radius;
    }
    #awesome {
      width: 150px;
      height: 150px;
      background-color: green;
      @include border-radius(15px);
    }
  </style>
  
  <div id="awesome"></div>
