<!--
    partials in sass are separate files that hold segments of css code
    these are imported and used in other sass files
    this is a great way to group similar code into a module to keep it organized
    names for partials with the underscore character ("_"), which tells sass it is a small segment of css and not to convert it into a css file
    also sass files end with the ".scss" file extension
    to bring the code in the partial into another sass file, use the "@import" directive
    for example, if all your mixins are samed in a partial named "_mixins.scss", and they are needed in the "main.css" file, this is how to use them in the main file:
    "@import 'mixins'"
    note that the underscore and file extension are not needed in the "import" statement -- sass understands it is a partial
    once a partial is imported into a file, al variables, mixins, and other code are available to use
-->
<!--
    write an "@import" statement to import a partial named "_variables.scss" into the "main.css" file
-->
<!-- The main.scss file -->
@import 'variables'
