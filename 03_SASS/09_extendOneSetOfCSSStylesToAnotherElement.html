<!--
    sass has a feature called "extend" that makes it easy to borrow the css rules from one element and build upon them in another
    for example, the below block of css rules style a ".panel" class
    it has a "background-color", "height" and "border"
    "
    .panel {
        background-color: red;
        height: 70px;
        border: 2px solid green;
    }
    "
    now you want another panel called ".big-panel"
    it has the same properties as ".panel", but also needs a "width" and "font-size"
    it's possible to copy and paste the initial css rules from ".panel", but the code becomes repetitive as you add way to reuse the rules written for one element, then add more for another:
    "
    .big-panel {
        @extend .panel;
        width: 150px;
        font-size: 2em;
    }
    "
    the ".big-panel" will have the same properties as ".panel" in addition to the new styles
-->
<!--
    make a class ".info-important" that extends ".info" and has a "background-color" set to magenta
-->
<style type='text/scss'>
    h3{
      text-align: center;
    }
    .info{
      width: 200px;
      border: 1px solid black;
      margin: 0 auto;
    }
    .info-important{
      @extend .info;
      background-color: magenta;
    }
  </style>
