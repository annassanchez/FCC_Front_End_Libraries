<!--
    the "@while" directive is an option with similar functionality to the js "while" loop
    it creates css rules until a condition is met
    the "@for" challenge gave an example to create grid system
    this can also work with "@while"
    "
    $x: 1;
    @while $x < 13 {
        .col-#{$x} { width: 1000%/12 * $x }
        $x: $x + 1;
    }
    "
    first, define a variable "$x" an set it to 1
    next use the "@while" directive to create the grid system while "$x" is less than 13
    after setting the css rules for "$width", "$x" is incremented by 1 to avoid an infinite loop
-->
<!--
    use "@while" to create a series of classes with different "font-sizes"
    there should be 5 different classes from "text-1" to "text-5"
    then set "font-size" to "15px" multiplied by the current index number
    make sure to avoid an infinite loop
-->
<style type='text/scss'>

      .text-#{$x} { font-size: 15px * $x;}

    }
