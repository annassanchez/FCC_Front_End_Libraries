<!--
    the "@for" directive adds styles in a loop, very similar to a "for" loop in js
    "@for" is used in two days: "start through end" or "start to end"
    the main difference is that the "start to end" excludes the end number as part of the count, and "start through end" includes the end number as part as the count
    here's a start through example:
    "
    @for $i from 1 through 12 {
        .col-#{i} { width: 100%/12 * $i; }
    }
    "
    the #{$i} part is the syntax to combine the variable (i) with text to make string
    when the sass file is converted to css, it looks like this:
    "
    .col-1 {
        width: 8.33333%;
    }

    .col-2 {
        width: 16.66667%;
    }

    ...

    .col-12 {
        width: 100%;
    }
    "
    this is a powerful way to create a grid layout
    now you have twelve options for column widths available as css classes
-->
<!--
    write "@for" directive that takes a variable "$j" that goes from 1 to 6
    it should create 5 classes called ".text-1" to ".text-5" where each has a "font-size" set to 15px by the index
-->
<style type='text/scss'>
    @for $i from 1 through 5 {
      .text-#{$i} { font-size: 15px * $i; }
    }
  </style>
  
  <p class="text-1">Hello</p>
  <p class="text-2">Hello</p>
  <p class="text-3">Hello</p>
  <p class="text-4">Hello</p>
  <p class="text-5">Hello</p>
