<!--
    sass allows nesting of css rules, which is a useful way of organizing a style sheet
    normally, wach element is targeted on a different line to syle, like so:
    "
    nav {
	    background-color: red;
    }

    nav ul {
        list-style: none;
    }

    nav ul il {
        display: inline-block;
    }
    "
    for a large project, the css file will have many lines and rules
    this is where nesting can help organize your code by placing child style rules within the respective parent elements
    "
    nav {
        background-color: red;
        ul {
            list-style: none;
            li {
                display: inline-block;
            }
        }
    } 
    "

<!--
    use the nesting techniques shown above to re-organize the css rules for both children of the ".blog-post" element
    for testing purposes, the "h1" should come before the "p" element
-->
<style type='text/scss'>
    .blog-post {
      h1 {
        text-align: center;
        color: blue;
      } 
      p {
        font-size: 20px;
      }
    } 
  </style>
  
  <div class="blog-post">
    <h1>Blog Title</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph</p>
  </div>
